<h2> The first regular meeting on 26th May
  <h3>
    1. Dr.Liu： A more complex mood model is needed for machine learning. Speech act theory is recommended. 

- **Reviewing speech act theory** 
  - Standford University:https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatics/
  - Other scholars' papers about speech act: Austin,Cappelen,Donnellan,etc
- **Write a literature review (6000-8000 words)**
  - Reviewing the theoretical development of the speech-act theory;
  - Reviewing the pratical application of this theory
- **Design an annotation scheme**



**2. Dr. Wang: Consider the research objectives and research questions. Focus on the manipulability and interpretatbliity of the data.**

- **Possible resource and models:VerbNet, Lin, Bert**

- **Consider research design**

  - What is your research objective?
  - What are the problems that this research aims to solve?
  - Why these problems are important?
  - What are innovative in this paper?
  - Provide the slides with concrete examples,application, features and evidence(data) 

- **Research on this field to avoid repetitive research**

  - Literature review

  - Survey

  - Market research

- **Prepare slides for the next regular meeting**

    - What are the questions in the last meeting? How to solve? 
    -  What is my research progress in the previous week? 
    - What is my plan next week? (provide more solutions)

   <h2> The second regular meeting on 03th June
  
  ** 1. The feasibility of tool**
       - What is the application of this tool? Think of a situation (not limited to academic writing)
       - Which theory is to be used? (Speech-act theory should have the context of interactions)
       - How to prove that it is an effective tool for teachers to save their time?
  
  ** 2. Reconside the innovations of this research**
  ** 3. Other specific questions**
       - What kinds of levels are considered?(word level/clause level/essay level)
            - Will it be possible for annotators to annotate very differently? How to aviod this?
            - Which dataset is to be used and how large will be the dataset?
